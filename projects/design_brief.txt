Portfolios:

https://jorgeatgu.com/: I like the simplicity, it’s easy to understand, it’s easy on the eyes. I dislike the color choices, it’s unclear looking at the homepage what the site is about, and I don’t like the choice of fonts.

“Jorge Aznar” is the header. The area under “Projects” and “Speaking * Podcasts” is the main. The footer is the contact links at the bottom.

http://www.justinaguilar.com/index.html: I like the fonts, the use of yellow, and the font size choice. I dislike how the cursor become a ball, I don’t like the changing photos, I don’t like that the yellow font doesn’t always have contrasting colors behind it which makes it difficult to read.

The first paragraph is the header. From “Shopify” to the last paragraph is the body. The footer is the empty space at the bottom. 

https://www.jessicahische.is/: I like the colors, the squiggles underlining the words is unique, and I like that it’s very informative. I dislike that it’s a little overwhelming how much is on this page, I think the email helper at the bottom is unnecessary, it’s hard to pick a third thing because I think this site is really good. 

The header is her name and the links to the different pages. The body is everything under that until the pencil. The copyright information is the footer.
