I would like to use #37008F as the background and white as the font. #7119FF will be the header. #DBD400 will be for links. Body will be #5400DB. I just thought it was an interesting combination when I was playing with the color wheel.

Header font will be Julius Sans One.
H2 will be Archivo Narrow
Font will be Source Sans Pro.

ABOUT ME

My name is Natassia Balderston. I current reside in San Francisco California and I’ve worked in the catering industry for 2 years. I’ve also been a student for the past four. I’m currently self teaching myself Python on Code Academy and also attempting to get into a program to get a Salesforce Admin certificate. But a majority of the past few years I’ve been working on my psychology degree because I want to be a therapist. 

It’s been very exciting getting back into educating myself. I was surprised how much I’ve enjoyed it. I’ve been needing to get into a real career and I think this is the best way. I’m very hopeful. I should be done with my psych degree in the next two years and I will continue to take more non-college courses.
